    "# Challenge 2: Predicting the externalizing factor from EEG\n",
    "\n",
    "The externalizing factor is a widely recognized construct in mental health research, representing a common underlying dimension of psychopathology across various disorders.\n",
    "Currently, the externalizing factor is often assessed using self-report questionnaires or clinician ratings, which can be subjective, prone to bias, and time-consuming.\n",
    "**The Challenge 2** consists of developing a model to predict the externalizing factor from EEG recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge encourages learning physiologically meaningful signal representations and discovery of reproducible biomarkers.\n",
    "Models of any size should emphasize robust, interpretable features that generalize across subjects,\n",
    "sessions, and acquisition sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a standard in-distribution classification task, this regression problem stresses out-of-distribution robustness\n",
    "and extrapolation. The goal is not only to minimize error on seen subjects, but also to transfer effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the dataset is available locally. If not, see the [dataset download guide](https://eeg2025.github.io/data/#downloading-the-data)"

    "We will establish direct communication channels with you over the next two months, resolve platform issues, and discuss other details.\n",

    "This is a community competition with a strong open-source foundation. When I say open-source, I mean volunteer work.\n",

    "\n",
    "The entire decoding community will only go further when we stop solving the same problems over and over again, and start working together."
