💾 Model Saving/Loading Ready!
Use save_model_as_pt() to save as .pt file
Use load_model_from_pt() to load from .pt file
📝 Example Usage:
1. Train your model
2. Save with: save_model_as_pt(model_conformer, filename='my_model.pt')
3. Load with: loaded_model = load_model_from_pt('my_model.pt', device)
4. Use loaded_model for inference

📁 Found existing .pt files:
   - submission_1/model_weights_challenge_1.pt (0.25 MB)
CUDA-enabled GPU found. Training should be faster.
